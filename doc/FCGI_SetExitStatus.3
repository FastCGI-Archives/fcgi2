NAME
     FCGI_SetExitStatus - fcgi_stdio compatibility library

SYNOPSIS
     #include "fcgi_stdio.h"

     void
     FCGI_SetExitStatus(int status);


DESCRIPTION
     Sets the exit status for the current FastCGI request.
     The exit status is the status code the request would have
     exited with, had the request been run as a CGI program.

     You can call FCGI_SetExitStatus several times during a request;
     the last call before the request ends determines the value.
