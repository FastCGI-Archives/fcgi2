<h3><a NAME = "S1">1. Introduction</a></h3>


Tcl (tool command language) is an embeddable scripting language
that's often used for CGI programming.  Tcl is freely available
as a source kit.<p>

We've built a Tcl interpreter that runs as a FastCGI application.  Our
purpose in doing so was twofold:

<ul>
    <li><i>Create a useful artifact.</i>
        Open Market has written many CGI applications using Tcl.
        Now we'd like to turn them into FastCGI applications.<p>
    <li><i>Demonstrate how easy it is to integrate FastCGI with an
        existing program.</i>
        The Tcl interpreter is a substantial program, so integrating
        FastCGI with the Tcl interpreter is a good test of the
        <tt>fcgi_stdio</tt> compatability library.
</ul>

We've succeeded on both counts.  We now have a platform for
migrating our Tcl-based CGI applications to FastCGI.  And
the integration required a very small effort.  The only source
code change to the Tcl interpreter was the routine addition of a
handful of new commands: <tt>FCGI_Accept</tt>, <tt>FCGI_Finish</tt>,
<tt>FCGI_SetExitStatus</tt>, and <tt>FCGI_StartFilterData</tt>.<p>

The FastCGI-integrated Tcl interpreter works as usual when run
from a shell or as a CGI program.  You don't need two Tcls,
one for FastCGI and one for other uses.<p>

The remainder of this document gives a recipe you can follow to
build FastCGI into Tcl, explains what's happening in the recipe,
and illustrates the use of FastCGI Tcl with
an example program.<p>

<h3><a NAME = "S2">2. Recipe</a></h3>

Here are the assumptions embedded in the following recipe:
<ul>
    <li>You are building Tcl 7.4p3, the current stable Tcl release
    as this is written.
    You unpack the Tcl kit into a directory <tt>tcl7.4</tt>
    that's a sibling of the FastCGI kit directory
    <tt>fcgi-devel-kit</tt>.<p>

    <li>You have gcc version 2.7
    installed on your system, and use it in the build.
    gcc is convenient because it supports the <tt>-include</tt>
    command-line option
    that instructs the C preprocessor to include a specific file before
    processing any other include files.  This allows you to include
    <tt>fcgi_stdio.h</tt> without modifying Tcl source files.  (The
    reason for specifying gcc version 2.7 is that I have
    experienced bad behavior with an earlier version and the <tt>-include</tt>
    flag -- the C preprocessor died with SIGABRT.)<p>

    <li>You have GNU autoconf
    installed on your system.  If you don't have GNU autoconf,
    you will have to make certain edits by hand and
    repeat these edits for each build platform.<p>
</ul>

If those are valid assumptions, follow these steps:
<ol>
    <li><i>Build the FastCGI Developer's Kit.</i>
    Tcl needs to link against <tt>libfcgi.a</tt>, so
    <a href="http://www.fastcgi.com/kit/doc/fcgi-devel-kit.htm#S2">build
    the FastCGI Developer's Kit</a>
    in order to create this library for your platform.<p>

    <li><i>Pull the Tcl 7.4p3 kit.</i>
    You'll need the files
    <a href="ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl/tcl7.4.tar.Z">tcl7.4.tar.Z</a>,
    <a href="ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl/tcl7.4p1.patch.gz">tcl7.4p1.patch.gz</a>,
    <a href="ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl/tcl7.4p2.patch.gz">tcl7.4p2.patch.gz</a>,
    and
    <a href="ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl/tcl7.4p3.patch.gz">tcl7.4p3.patch.gz</a>.
    (Some older Netscape browsers can't perform these
    retrievals because of a protocol conflict between Netscape
    and Sun's firewall.)<p>

    Unpack the tar file in the parent directory of the
    FastCGI kit directory you used in the previous step,
    so that the directories <tt>tcl7.4</tt> and <tt>fcgi-devel-kit</tt>
    are siblings.  After unpacking the tar file, follow the directions
    in the <tt>README</tt> to apply the patches.<p>

    The <a href="http://www.sunlabs.com:80/research/tcl/">Sun Labs Tcl/Tk
    Project Page</a> contains a wealth of information on Tcl, including
    up to date information on the latest kits.<p>

    <li><i>Copy the files <tt>tclFCGI.c</tt>, <tt>tclAppInit.c</tt>,
        <tt>Makefile.in</tt>, and <tt>configure.in</tt> from the FastCGI kit.</i>
    <pre>
    > cd tcl7.4
    > mv tclAppInit.c tclAppInit.c.orig
    > mv Makefile.in.orig Makefile.in.orig.orig
    > mv Makefile.in Makefile.in.orig
    > mv configure.in configure.in.orig
    > cp ../fcgi-devel-kit/tcl/tcl7.4/* .
    > cp ../fcgi-devel-kit/tcl/common/* .</pre>

    <li><i>Create a new <tt>configure</tt> script.</i>
    <pre>
    > autoconf</pre>

    <li><i>Configure and build.</i>
    <pre>
    > ./configure
    > make</pre>
    The <tt>make</tt> creates the Tcl interpreter <tt>tclsh</tt>
    and library archive <tt>libtcl.a</tt> (for embedding Tcl in
    your own C applications).  The Tcl <tt>README</tt> file
    explains how you can experiment with <tt>tclsh</tt>
    without installing it in a standard place.<p>
</ol>

<h3><a NAME = "S3">3. Recipe Explained</a></h3>

The recipe alone is fine if you are using Tcl 7.4p3, you have gcc
version 2.7, and you have GNU autoconf.  In case one or more of these
assumptions doesn't hold for you, and to illuminate how little work was
involved in integrating FastCGI, here's an explanation of how
and why you would modify the files <tt>tclAppInit.c</tt>,
<tt>Makefile.in</tt>, and <tt>configure.in</tt> from the Tcl kit.

<ul>
    <li><tt>tclAppInit.c</tt>:<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add the following three lines of code
        to the function <tt>Tcl_AppInit</tt> after the call
        to <tt>Tcl_Init</tt> and after the comment about calling init
        procedures:
        <pre>
    if (FCGI_Init(interp) == TCL_ERROR) {
        return TCL_ERROR;
    }</pre>
        This registers four Tcl commands (<tt>FCGI_Accept</tt>,
        <tt>FCGI_Finish</tt>, <tt>FCGI_SetExitStatus</tt>, and
        <tt>FCGI_StartFilterData</tt>), implemented in
        <tt>tclFCGI.c</tt>, with the Tcl interpreter.<p>
    </ul>

    <li><tt>Makefile.in</tt>:<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add <tt>tclFCGI.o</tt> to the <tt>GENERIC_OBJS</tt> variable, and
            add <tt>tclFCGI.c</tt> to the <tt>SRCS</tt> variable.<p>

            This builds the FastCGI Tcl commands and
            links them into the Tcl interpreter.<p>

        <li>Add <tt>-I../fcgi-devel-kit/include
                    -include ../fcgi-devel-kit/include/fcgi_stdio.h</tt>
            to the <tt>CFLAGS</tt> variable.<p>

            This includes <tt>fcgi_stdio.h</tt>
            when compiling C code for the Tcl interpreter, overriding
            the normal <tt>stdio</tt> types, variables, and functions.<p>

        <li>Add <tt>../fcgi-devel-kit/libfcgi/libfcgi.a</tt> before the
            <tt>@LIBS@</tt> part of the <tt>LIBS</tt> variable.<p>

            This links the implementation of <tt>fcgi_stdio.h</tt>
            into the Tcl interpreter, for use by the <tt>FCGI_accept</tt>
            command and any code that uses <tt>stdio</tt> variables
            or calls <tt>stdio</tt> functions.<p>
    </ul><p>

    The last two edits will vary if you use a compiler other than gcc or
    install the <tt>tcl7.4</tt> directory
    somewhere else in relation to the <tt>fcgi-devel-kit</tt> directory.<p>

    <li><tt>configure.in</tt>:<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        Replace the lines
        <pre>
AC_C_CROSS
CC=${CC-cc}</pre>
        with the lines
        <pre>
AC_PROG_CC
AC_C_CROSS</pre>
        This selects gcc in preference to other C compilers.<p>
         
        <li>
        Add the following lines just after the
        <tt>AC_SUBST(CC)</tt> line:
        <pre>
AC_CHECK_LIB(socket, main, [LIBS="$LIBS -lsocket"])
AC_CHECK_LIB(nsl, main, [LIBS="$LIBS -lnsl"])
AC_SUBST(LIBS)</pre>
        This ensures that the socket libraries used by FastCGI
        are linked into the Tcl interpreter.<p>
    </ul>
    If GNU autoconf is not available to you, you'll leave
    <tt>configure.in</tt> alone and perform the following steps:<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        Execute
        <pre>
    > SETENV CC gcc</pre>
        before running <tt>configure</tt>.<p>

        <li>
        If you are running on a SVR4-derived Unix platform,
        edit <tt>Makefile</tt> to add
        <tt>-lsocket -lnsl</tt> to the <tt>LIBS</tt> value
        after running <tt>configure</tt>.<p>
    </ul>
    If you ever re-run <tt>configure</tt>, you'll need to repeat
    these steps.<p>

</ul>


<h3><a NAME = "S4">4. Writing FastCGI applications in Tcl</a></h3>

The Tcl program <tt>tcl/tiny-tcl-fcgi</tt> performs the same
function as the C program <tt>examples/tiny-fcgi.c</tt>
that's used as an example in the
<a href="fcgi-devel-kit.html#S3.1.1">FastCGI Developer's Kit
document</a>.  Here's what the Tcl version looks like:<p>

<pre>
#!./tclsh
set count 0 
while {[FCGI_Accept] &gt;= 0 } {
    incr count
    puts -nonewline "Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n"
    puts "&lt;title&gt;FastCGI Hello! (Tcl)&lt;/title&gt;"
    puts "&lt;h1&gt;FastCGI Hello! (Tcl)&lt;/h1&gt;"
    puts "Request number $count running on host &lt;i&gt;$env(SERVER_NAME)&lt;/i&gt;"
}
</pre>

If you've built Tcl according to the recipe and you have a Web server
set up to run FastCGI applications, load the FastCGI Developer's Kit
Index Page in that server and run this Tcl application now.<p>

The script invokes Tcl indirectly via the symbolic link
<tt>examples/tclsh</tt>.  It does this because HP-UX has a limit of 32
characters for the first line of a command-interpreter file such as
<tt>examples/tiny-tcl-fcgi</tt>.  If you run on HP-UX you won't want
to sprinkle symbolic links to <tt>tclsh</tt> everywhere, so you should install
<tt>tclsh</tt> with a shorter pathname than
<tt>/usr/local/tcl7.4-fcgi/bin/tclsh7.4</tt>.<p>

The Tcl command <tt>FCGI_Accept</tt> treats the initial
environment differently than the C function <tt>FCGI_Accept</tt>.  The
first call to the
C function <tt>FCGI_Accept</tt> replaces the initial environment with
the environment of the first request.  The first call to the Tcl command
<tt>FCGI_Accept</tt> adds the variable bindings of the first request
to the bindings present in the initial environment.  So when the first
call to <tt>FCGI_Accept</tt> returns, bindings from the initial
environment are still there (unless, due to naming conflicts, some of
them have been overwritten by the first request).  The next call to
<tt>FCGI_Accept</tt> removes the bindings made on the previous call
before adding a new set for the request just accepted, again preserving
the initial environment.<p>

The FastCGI-integrated <tt>tclsh</tt> also includes
commands <tt>FCGI_Finish</tt>, <tt>FCGI_SetExitStatus</tt>,
and <tt>FCGI_StartFilterData</tt> that correspond to
C functions in <tt>fcgi_stdio.h</tt>; see the manpages for
full information.<p>

Converting a Tcl CGI application to FastCGI is not fundamentally
different from converting a C CGI application.  You separate
the portion of the application that performs one-time
initialization from the portion that performs per-request
processing.  You put the per-request processing into a loop
controlled by <tt>FCGI_Accept</tt>.<p>
