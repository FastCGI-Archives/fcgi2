         <A NAME="S1">1. Introduction</A>
      </H3>
      <P>
         FastCGI is an open extension to CGI that provides high performance for all Internet applications without the
         penalties of Web server APIs.
      </P>
      <P>
         This specification has narrow goal: to specify, from an application perspective, the interface between a
         FastCGI application and a Web server that supports FastCGI. Many Web server features related to FastCGI, e.g.
         application management facilities, have nothing to do with the application to Web server interface, and are
         not described here.
      </P>
      <P>
         This specification is for Unix (more precisely, for POSIX systems that support Berkeley Sockets). The bulk of
         the specification is a simple communications protocol that is independent of byte ordering and will extend to
         other systems.
      </P>
      <P>
         We&#39;ll introduce FastCGI by comparing it with conventional Unix implementations of CGI/1.1. FastCGI is
         designed to support long-lived application processes, i.e. <I>application servers</I>. That&#39;s a major
         difference compared with conventional Unix implementations of CGI/1.1, which construct an application process,
         use it respond to one request, and have it exit.
      </P>
      <P>
         The initial state of a FastCGI process is more spartan than the initial state of a CGI/1.1 process, because
         the FastCGI process doesn&#39;t begin life connected to anything. It doesn&#39;t have the conventional open
         files <TT>stdin</TT>, <TT>stdout</TT>, and <TT>stderr</TT>, and it doesn&#39;t receive much information
         through environment variables. The key piece of initial state in a FastCGI process is a listening socket,
         through which it accepts connections from a Web server.
      </P>
      <P>
         After a FastCGI process accepts a connection on its listening socket, the process executes a simple protocol
         to receive and send data. The protocol serves two purposes. First, the protocol multiplexes a single transport
         connection between several independent FastCGI requests. This supports applications that are able to process
         concurrent requests using event-driven or multi-threaded programming techniques. Second, within each request
         the protocol provides several independent data streams in each direction. This way, for instance, both
         <TT>stdout</TT> and <TT>stderr</TT> data pass over a single transport connection from the application to the
         Web server, rather than requiring separate pipes as with CGI/1.1.
      </P>
      <P>
         A FastCGI application plays one of several well-defined <I>roles</I>. The most familiar is the
         <I>Responder</I> role, in which the application receives all the information associated with an HTTP request
         and generates an HTTP response; that&#39;s the role CGI/1.1 programs play. A second role is <I>Authorizer</I>,
         in which the application receives all the information associated with an HTTP request and generates an
         authorized/unauthorized decision. A third role is <I>Filter</I>, in which the application receives all the
         information associated with an HTTP request, plus an extra stream of data from a file stored on the Web
         server, and generates a &quot;filtered&quot; version of the data stream as an HTTP response. The framework is
         extensible so that more FastCGI can be defined later.
      </P>
      <P>
         In the remainder of this specification the terms &quot;FastCGI application,&quot; &quot;application
         process,&quot; or &quot;application server&quot; are abbreviated to &quot;application&quot; whenever that
         won&#39;t cause confusion.

      <H4>
         <A NAME="S2.1">2.1 Argument list</A>
      </H4>
      <P>
         By default the Web server creates an argument list containing a single element, the name of the application,
         taken to be the last component of the executable&#39;s path name. The Web server may provide a way to specify
         a different application name, or a more elaborate argument list.
      </P>
      <P>
         Note that the file executed by the Web server might be an interpreter file (a text file that starts with the
         characters <TT>#!</TT>), in which case the application&#39;s argument list is constructed as described in the
         <TT>execve</TT> manpage.
      </P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <H4>
         <A NAME="S2.2">2.2 File descriptors</A>
      </H4>
      <P>
         The Web server leaves a single file descriptor, <TT>FCGI_LISTENSOCK_FILENO</TT>, open when the application
         begins execution. This descriptor refers to a listening socket created by the Web server.
      </P>
      <P>
         <TT>FCGI_LISTENSOCK_FILENO</TT> equals <TT>STDIN_FILENO</TT>. The standard descriptors <TT>STDOUT_FILENO</TT>
         and <TT>STDERR_FILENO</TT> are closed when the application begins execution. A reliable method for an
         application to determine whether it was invoked using CGI or FastCGI is to call
         <TT>getpeername(FCGI_LISTENSOCK_FILENO)</TT>, which returns -1 with <TT>errno</TT> set to <TT>ENOTCONN</TT>
         for a FastCGI application.
      </P>
      <P>
         The Web server&#39;s choice of reliable transport, Unix stream pipes (<TT>AF_UNIX</TT>) or TCP/IP
         (<TT>AF_INET</TT>), is implicit in the internal state of the <TT>FCGI_LISTENSOCK_FILENO</TT> socket.
      </P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <H4>
         <A NAME="S2.3">2.3 Environment variables</A>
      </H4>
      <P>
         The Web server may use environment variables to pass parameters to the application. This specification defines
         one such variable, <TT>FCGI_WEB_SERVER_ADDRS</TT>; we expect more to be defined as the specification evolves.
         The Web server may provide a way to bind other environment variables, such as the <TT>PATH</TT> variable.
      </P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <H4>
         <A NAME="S2.4">2.4 Other state</A>
      </H4>
      <P>
         The Web server may provide a way to specify other components of an application&#39;s initial process state,
         such as the priority, user ID, group ID, root directory, and working directory of the process.
      </P>

      <H4>
         <A NAME="S3.1">3.1 Notation</A>
      </H4>
      <P>
         We use C language notation to define protocol message formats. All structure elements are defined in terms of
         the <TT>unsigned char</TT> type, and are arranged so that an ISO C compiler lays them out in the obvious
         manner, with no padding. The first byte defined in the structure is transmitted first, the second byte second,
         etc.
      </P>
      <P>
         We use two conventions to abbreviate our definitions.
      </P>
      <P>
         First, when two adjacent structure components are named identically except for the suffixes
         &quot;<TT>B1</TT>&quot; and &quot;<TT>B0</TT>,&quot; it means that the two components may be viewed as a
         single number, computed as <TT>B1&lt;&lt;8 + B0</TT>. The name of this single number is the name of the
         components, minus the suffixes. This convention generalizes in an obvious way to handle numbers represented in
         more than two bytes.
      </P>
      <P>
         Second, we extend C <TT>struct</TT>s to allow the form

<PRE>
        struct {
            unsigned char mumbleLengthB1;
            unsigned char mumbleLengthB0;
            ... /* other stuff */

         <A NAME="S3.2">3.2 Accepting Transport Connections</A>
      </H4>
      <P>
         A FastCGI application calls <TT>accept()</TT> on the socket referred to by file descriptor
         <TT>FCGI_LISTENSOCK_FILENO</TT> to accept a new transport connection. If the <TT>accept()</TT> succeeds, and
         the <TT>FCGI_WEB_SERVER_ADDRS</TT> environment variable is bound, the application application immediately
         performs the following special processing:

            <P>
               If <TT>FCGI_WEB_SERVER_ADDRS</TT> was bound, the application checks the peer IP address of the new
               connection for membership in the list. If the check fails (including the possibility that the connection
               didn&#39;t use TCP/IP transport), the application responds by closing the connection.
            </P>
            <P>
               <TT>FCGI_WEB_SERVER_ADDRS</TT> is expressed as a comma-separated list of IP addresses. Each IP address
               is written as four decimal numbers in the range [0..255] separated by decimal points. So one legal
               binding for this variable is <TT>FCGI_WEB_SERVER_ADDRS=199.170.183.28,199.170.183.71</TT>.

         <A NAME="S3.3">3.3 Records</A>
      </H4>
      <P>
         Applications execute requests from a Web server using a simple protocol. Details of the protocol depend upon
         the application&#39;s role, but roughly speaking the Web server first sends parameters and other data to the
         application, then the application sends result data to the Web server, and finally the application sends the
         Web server an indication that the request is complete.
      </P>
      <P>
         All data that flows over the transport connection is carried in <I>FastCGI records</I>. FastCGI records
         accomplish two things. First, records multiplex the transport connection between several independent FastCGI
         requests. This multiplexing supports applications that are able to process concurrent requests using
         event-driven or multi-threaded programming techniques. Second, records provide several independent data
         streams in each direction within a single request. This way, for instance, both <TT>stdout</TT> and
         <TT>stderr</TT> data can pass over a single transport connection from the application to the Web server,
         rather than requiring separate connections.

         Padding
      </H5>
      <P>
         The protocol allows senders to pad the records they send, and requires receivers to interpret the
         <TT>paddingLength</TT> and skip the <TT>paddingData</TT>. Padding allows senders to keep data aligned for more
         efficient processing. Experience with the X window system protocols shows the performance benefit of such
         alignment.
      </P>
      <P>
         We recommend that records be placed on boundaries that are multiples of eight bytes. The fixed-length portion
         of a <TT>FCGI_Record</TT> is eight bytes.

      <H5>
         Managing Request IDs
      </H5>
      <P>
         The Web server re-uses FastCGI request IDs; the application keeps track of the current state of each request
         ID on a given transport connection. A request ID <TT>R</TT> becomes active when the application receives a
         record <TT>{FCGI_BEGIN_REQUEST, R, ...}</TT> and becomes inactive when the application sends a record
         <TT>{FCGI_END_REQUEST, R, ...}</TT> to the Web server.
      </P>
      <P>
         While a request ID <TT>R</TT> is inactive, the application ignores records with <TT>requestId == R</TT>,
         except for <TT>FCGI_BEGIN_REQUEST</TT> records as just described.
      </P>
      <P>
         The Web server attempts to keep FastCGI request IDs small. That way the application can keep track of request
         ID states using a short array rather than a long array or a hash table. An application also has the option of
         accepting only one request at a time. In this case the application simply checks incoming <TT>requestId</TT>
         values against the current request ID.
      </P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <H5>
         Types of Record Types
      </H5>
      <P>
         There are two useful ways of classifying FastCGI record types.
      </P>
      <P>
         The first distinction is between <I>management</I> records and <I>application</I> records. A management record
         contains information that is not specific to any Web server request, such as information about the protocol
         capabilities of the application. An application record contains information about a particular request,
         identified by the <TT>requestId</TT> component.
      </P>
      <P>
         Management records have a <TT>requestId</TT> value of zero, also called the <I>null request ID</I>.
         Application records have a nonzero <TT>requestId</TT>.
      </P>
      <P>
         The second distinction is between <I>discrete</I> and <I>stream</I> records. A discrete record contains a
         meaningful unit of data all by itself. A stream record is part of a <I>stream</I>, i.e. a series of zero or
         more non-empty records (<TT>length != 0</TT>) of the stream type, followed by an empty record (<TT>length ==
         0</TT>) of the stream type. The <TT>contentData</TT> components of a stream&#39;s records, when concatenated,
         form a byte sequence; this byte sequence is the value of the stream. Therefore the value of a stream is
         independent of how many records it contains or how its bytes are divided among the non-empty records.
      </P>
      <P>
         These two classifications are independent. Among the record types defined in this version of the FastCGI
         protocol, all management record types are also discrete record types, and nearly all application record types
         are stream record types. But three application record types are discrete, and nothing prevents defining a
         management record type that&#39;s a stream in some later version of the protocol.
      </P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <H4>
         <A NAME="S3.4">3.4 Name-Value Pairs</A>
      </H4>
      <P>
         In many of their roles, FastCGI applications need to read and write varying numbers of variable-length values.
         So it is useful to adopt a standard format for encoding a name-value pair.
      </P>
      <P>
         FastCGI transmits a name-value pair as the length of the name, followed by the length of the value, followed
         by the name, followed by the value. Lengths of 127 bytes and less can be encoded in one byte, while longer
         lengths are always encoded in four bytes:

      <P>
         The high-order bit of the first byte of a length indicates the length&#39;s encoding. A high-order zero
         implies a one-byte encoding, a one a four-byte encoding.
      </P>
      <P>
         This name-value pair format allows the sender to transmit binary values without additional encoding, and
         enables the receiver to allocate the correct amount of storage immediately even for large values.

         <A NAME="S3.5">3.5 Closing Transport Connections</A>
      </H4>
      <P>
         The Web server controls the lifetime of transport connections. The Web server can close a connection when no
         requests are active. Or the Web server can delegate close authority to the application (see
         <TT>FCGI_BEGIN_REQUEST</TT>). In this case the application closes the connection at the end of a specified
         request.
      </P>
      <P>
         This flexibility accommodates a variety of application styles. Simple applications will process one request at
         a time and accept a new transport connection for each request. More complex applications will process
         concurrent requests, over one or multiple transport connections, and will keep transport connections open for
         long periods of time.
      </P>
      <P>
         A simple application gets a significant performance boost by closing the transport connection when it has
         finished writing its response. The Web server needs to control the connection lifetime for long-lived
         connections.
      </P>
      <P>
         When an application closes a connection or finds that a connection has closed, the application initiates a new
         connection.

         <A NAME="S6.1">6.1 Role Protocols</A>
      </H4>
      <P>
         Role protocols only include records with application record types. They transfer essentially all data using
         streams.
      </P>
      <P>
         To make the protocols reliable and to simplify application programming, role protocols are designed to use
         <I>nearly sequential marshalling</I>. In a protocol with strictly sequential marshalling, the application
         receives its first input, then its second, etc. until it has received them all. Similarly, the application
         sends its first output, then its second, etc. until it has sent them all. Inputs are not interleaved with each
         other, and outputs are not interleaved with each other.
      </P>
      <P>
         The sequential marshalling rule is too restrictive for some FastCGI roles, because CGI programs can write to
         both <TT>stdout</TT> and <TT>stderr</TT> without timing restrictions. So role protocols that use both
         <TT>FCGI_STDOUT</TT> and <TT>FCGI_STDERR</TT> allow these two streams to be interleaved.
      </P>
      <P>
         All role protocols use the <TT>FCGI_STDERR</TT> stream just the way <TT>stderr</TT> is used in conventional
         applications programming: to report application-level errors in an intelligible way. Use of the
         <TT>FCGI_STDERR</TT> stream is always optional. If an application has no errors to report, it sends either no
         <TT>FCGI_STDERR</TT> records or one zero-length <TT>FCGI_STDERR</TT> record.
      </P>
      <P>
         When a role protocol calls for transmitting a stream other than <TT>FCGI_STDERR</TT>, at least one record of
         the stream type is always transmitted, even if the stream is empty.
      </P>
      <P>
         Again in the interests of reliable protocols and simplified application programming, role protocols are
         designed to be <I>nearly request-response</I>. In a truly request-response protocol, the application receives
         all of its input records before sending its first output record. Request-response protocols don&#39;t allow
         pipelining.
      </P>
      <P>
         The request-response rule is too restrictive for some FastCGI roles; after all, CGI programs aren&#39;t
         restricted to read all of <TT>stdin</TT> before starting to write <TT>stdout</TT>. So some role protocols
         allow that specific possibility. First the application receives all of its inputs except for a final stream
         input. As the application begins to receive the final stream input, it can begin writing its output.
      </P>
      <P>
         When a role protocol uses <TT>FCGI_PARAMS</TT> to transmit textual values, such as the values that CGI
         programs obtain from environment variables, the length of the value does not include the terminating null
         byte, and the value itself does not include a null byte. An application that needs to provide
         <TT>environ(7)</TT> format name-value pairs must insert an equal sign between the name and value and append a
         null byte after the value.
      </P>
      <P>
         Role protocols do not support the non-parsed header feature of CGI. FastCGI applications set response status
         using the <TT>Status</TT> and <TT>Location</TT> CGI headers.
      </P>

         <A NAME="S6.2">6.2 Responder</A>
      </H4>
      <P>
         A Responder FastCGI application has the same purpose as a CGI/1.1 program: It receives all the information
         associated with an HTTP request and generates an HTTP response.
      </P>
      <P>
         It suffices to explain how each element of CGI/1.1 is emulated by a Responder:

            Next the Responder application receives CGI/1.1 <TT>stdin</TT> data from the Web server over
            <TT>FCGI_STDIN</TT>. The application receives at most <TT>CONTENT_LENGTH</TT> bytes from this stream before
            receiving the end-of-stream indication. (The application receives less than <TT>CONTENT_LENGTH</TT> bytes
            only if the HTTP client fails to provide them, e.g. because the client crashed.)

            one after the other. The application must wait to finish reading <TT>FCGI_PARAMS</TT> before it begins
            writing <TT>FCGI_STDOUT</TT> and <TT>FCGI_STDERR</TT>, but it needn&#39;t finish reading from

         <LI>
            After sending all its <TT>stdout</TT> and <TT>stderr</TT> data, the Responder application sends a
            <TT>FCGI_END_REQUEST</TT> record. The application sets the <TT>protocolStatus</TT> component to

      <P>
         A Responder performing an update, e.g. implementing a <TT>POST</TT> method, should compare the number of bytes

         <A NAME="S6.3">6.3 Authorizer</A>

      <P>
         An Authorizer FastCGI application receives all the information associated with an HTTP request and generates
         an authorized/unauthorized decision. In case of an authorized decision the Authorizer can also associate
         name-value pairs with the HTTP request; when giving an unauthorized decision the Authorizer sends a complete
         response to the HTTP client.
      </P>
      <P>
         Since CGI/1.1 defines a perfectly good way to represent the information associated with an HTTP request,
         Authorizers use the same representation:

      <P>
      </P>
      <UL TYPE="square">
         <LI>
            The Authorizer application receives HTTP request information from the Web server on the
            <TT>FCGI_PARAMS</TT> stream, in the same format as a Responder. The Web server does not send
            <TT>CONTENT_LENGTH</TT>, <TT>PATH_INFO</TT>, <TT>PATH_TRANSLATED</TT>, and <TT>SCRIPT_NAME</TT> headers.
            <P>
            </P>
         </LI>
         <LI>
            The Authorizer application sends <TT>stdout</TT> and <TT>stderr</TT> data in the same manner as a
            Responder. The CGI/1.1 response status specifies the disposition of the request. If the application sends
            status 200 (OK), the Web server allows access. Depending upon its configuration the Web server may proceed
            with other access checks, including requests to other Authorizers.
            <P>
               An Authorizer application&#39;s 200 response may include headers whose names are prefixed with
               <TT>Variable-</TT>. These headers communicate name-value pairs from the application to the Web server.
               For instance, the response header
            </P>
<PRE>
        Variable-AUTH_METHOD: database lookup
</PRE>
            transmits the value <TT>&quot;database lookup&quot;</TT> with name <TT>AUTH-METHOD</TT>. The server
            associates such name-value pairs with the HTTP request and includes them in subsequent CGI or FastCGI
            requests performed in processing the HTTP request. When the application gives a 200 response, the server
            ignores response headers whose names aren&#39;t prefixed with <TT>Variable-</TT> prefix, and ignores any
            response content.
            <P>
               For Authorizer response status values other than &quot;200&quot; (OK), the Web server denies access and
               sends the response status, headers, and content back to the HTTP client.

      <P>
         A Filter FastCGI application receives all the information associated with an HTTP request, plus an extra
         stream of data from a file stored on the Web server, and generates a &quot;filtered&quot; version of the data
         stream as an HTTP response.
      </P>
      <P>
         A Filter is similar in functionality to a Responder that takes a data file as a parameter. The difference is
         that with a Filter, both the data file and the Filter itself can be access controlled using the Web
         server&#39;s access control mechanisms, while a Responder that takes the name of a data file as a parameter
         must perform its own access control checks on the data file.
      </P>
      <P>
         The steps taken by a Filter are similar to those of a Responder. The server presents the Filter with
         environment variables first, then standard input (normally form <TT>POST</TT> data), finally the data file
         input:

            1970 UTC) is <TT>FCGI_DATA_LAST_MOD</TT>; the application may consult this variable and respond from a
            cache without reading the file data. The application reads at most <TT>FCGI_DATA_LENGTH</TT> bytes from

         A FastCGI application exits with zero status to indicate that it terminated on purpose, e.g. in order to

         1. A simple request with no data on <TT>stdin</TT>, and a successful response:
      </P>
<PRE>
{FCGI_BEGIN_REQUEST,   1, {FCGI_RESPONDER, 0}}
{FCGI_PARAMS,          1, &quot;\013\002SERVER_PORT80\013\016SERVER_ADDR199.170.183.42 ... &quot;}
{FCGI_PARAMS,          1, &quot;&quot;}
{FCGI_STDIN,           1, &quot;&quot;}

    {FCGI_STDOUT,      1, &quot;Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt; ... &quot;}
    {FCGI_STDOUT,      1, &quot;&quot;}
    {FCGI_END_REQUEST, 1, {0, FCGI_REQUEST_COMPLETE}}
</PRE>
      <P>
         2. Similar to example 1, but this time with data on <TT>stdin</TT>. The Web server chooses to send the
         parameters using more <TT>FCGI_PARAMS</TT> records than before:
      </P>
<PRE>
{FCGI_BEGIN_REQUEST,   1, {FCGI_RESPONDER, 0}}
{FCGI_PARAMS,          1, &quot;\013\002SERVER_PORT80\013\016SER&quot;}
{FCGI_PARAMS,          1, &quot;VER_ADDR199.170.183.42 ... &quot;}
{FCGI_PARAMS,          1, &quot;&quot;}
{FCGI_STDIN,           1, &quot;quantity=100&amp;item=3047936&quot;}
{FCGI_STDIN,           1, &quot;&quot;}

    {FCGI_STDOUT,      1, &quot;Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt; ... &quot;}
    {FCGI_STDOUT,      1, &quot;&quot;}
    {FCGI_END_REQUEST, 1, {0, FCGI_REQUEST_COMPLETE}}
</PRE>
      <P>
         3. Similar to example 1, but this time the application detects an error. The application logs a message to
         <TT>stderr</TT>, returns a page to the client, and returns non-zero exit status to the Web server. The
         application chooses to send the page using more <TT>FCGI_STDOUT</TT> records:
      </P>
<PRE>
{FCGI_BEGIN_REQUEST,   1, {FCGI_RESPONDER, 0}}
{FCGI_PARAMS,          1, &quot;\013\002SERVER_PORT80\013\016SERVER_ADDR199.170.183.42 ... &quot;}
{FCGI_PARAMS,          1, &quot;&quot;}
{FCGI_STDIN,           1, &quot;&quot;}

    {FCGI_STDOUT,      1, &quot;Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n&lt;ht&quot;}
    {FCGI_STDERR,      1, &quot;config error: missing SI_UID\n&quot;}
    {FCGI_STDOUT,      1, &quot;ml&gt;\n&lt;head&gt; ... &quot;}
    {FCGI_STDOUT,      1, &quot;&quot;}
    {FCGI_STDERR,      1, &quot;&quot;}
    {FCGI_END_REQUEST, 1, {938, FCGI_REQUEST_COMPLETE}}
</PRE>
      <P>
         4. Two instances of example 1, multiplexed onto a single connection. The first request is more difficult than
         the second, so the application finishes the requests out of order:
      </P>
<PRE>
{FCGI_BEGIN_REQUEST,   1, {FCGI_RESPONDER, FCGI_KEEP_CONN}}
{FCGI_PARAMS,          1, &quot;\013\002SERVER_PORT80\013\016SERVER_ADDR199.170.183.42 ... &quot;}
{FCGI_PARAMS,          1, &quot;&quot;}
{FCGI_BEGIN_REQUEST,   2, {FCGI_RESPONDER, FCGI_KEEP_CONN}}
{FCGI_PARAMS,          2, &quot;\013\002SERVER_PORT80\013\016SERVER_ADDR199.170.183.42 ... &quot;}
{FCGI_STDIN,           1, &quot;&quot;}

    {FCGI_STDOUT,      1, &quot;Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n&quot;}

{FCGI_PARAMS,          2, &quot;&quot;}
{FCGI_STDIN,           2, &quot;&quot;}

    {FCGI_STDOUT,      2, &quot;Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt; ... &quot;}
    {FCGI_STDOUT,      2, &quot;&quot;}
    {FCGI_END_REQUEST, 2, {0, FCGI_REQUEST_COMPLETE}}
    {FCGI_STDOUT,      1, &quot;&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt; ... &quot;}
    {FCGI_STDOUT,      1, &quot;&quot;}
    {FCGI_END_REQUEST, 1, {0, FCGI_REQUEST_COMPLETE}}
