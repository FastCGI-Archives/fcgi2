NAME
     FCGI_Finish
         - fcgi_stdio compatibility library

SYNOPSIS
     #include "fcgi_stdio.h"

     void
     FCGI_Finish(void);


DESCRIPTION
     The FCGI_Finish function finishes the current request from the
     HTTP server.  The current request was started by the most recent
     call to FCGI_Accept(3).

     FCGI_Finish allows an application to interleave other activities
     with the processing of requests.  In an extreme case, an
     application would call FCGI_Finish to complete the current
     request before exiting, e.g. to reclaim leaked storage.

     In completing the current request, FCGI_Finish may detect
     errors, e.g. a broken pipe to a client who has disconnected
     early.  FCGI_Finish ignores such errors.  An application
     that wishes to handle such errors should explicitly call
     fclose(stderr), then fclose(stdout); an EOF return from
     either one indicates an error.

     FCGI_Finish frees any storage allocated by the most recent call
     to FCGI_Accept.  See FCGI_Accept(3) for warnings against retaining
     pointers to this storage.
