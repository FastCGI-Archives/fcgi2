NAME
     FCGI_StartFilterData - fcgi_stdio compatibility library

SYNOPSIS
     #include "fcgi_stdio.h"

     int
     FCGI_StartFilterData(void);


DESCRIPTION
     Enables a FastCGI Filter application to begin reading its filter
     input data from stdin.

     In order to call FCGI_StartFilterData, the FastCGI
     application should have been invoked in the Filter role
     (getenv("FCGI_ROLE") == "FILTER"), and should have read
     stdin to EOF, consuming the entire FCGI_STDIN data stream.
     The call to FCGI_StartFilterData positions stdin at the
     start of FCGI_DATA.

     If the preconditions are not met (e.g. the application has
     not read stdin to EOF), FCGI_StartFilterData returns
     a negative result, and the application will get EOF on attempts
     to read from stdin.

     The application can determine the number of bytes available
     on FCGI_DATA by performing atoi(getenv("FCGI_DATA_LENGTH")).
     If fewer than this many bytes are delievered on stdin after
     calling FCGI_StartFilterData, the application should perform
     an application-specific error response.  If the application
     normally makes an update, most likely it should abort the update.

     The application can determine last modification time of the
     filter input data by performing getenv("FCGI_DATA_LAST_MOD").
     This allows applications to perform caching based on last
     modification time.

     
RETURN VALUES
     0 for successful call, < 0 for error.
